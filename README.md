This is my setup.

 - [Windows Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as you are most likely to use it if you are using Windows
 - [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), as the interactive shell
 - [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), as the terminal multiplexer
 - [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), as the prompt theme engine
 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as the editor for Windows
 - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), as the editor in the terminal

You need a Nerd Font installed. You can download it [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

If you're using Linux, run `./install` after cloning.

You can use `.aliasrc` in your home directory for aliases.
